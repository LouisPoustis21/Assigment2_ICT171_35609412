        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
        <p>
            For my cloud project in the ICT171 unit, I have chosen to create a <strong>personal travel blog</strong> hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. The purpose of this blog is to share key moments from my travels across different cities and countries, through blog posts that include text, images, and interactive maps. The website will initially have static content, but later versions will include dynamic functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website will be developed using front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The current content will be static, but I plan to implement a back-end (either PHP or Python) and a database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) in the future to manage articles dynamically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the features I plan to include:
        </p>
        <p>
           		Adding blog posts with titles, dates, text, images, and geolocation
            		Displaying an interactive map (via APIs such as Leaflet or Google Maps)
            		A photo gallery to showcase the best travel moments
            		A contact page with a form or direct links to my social media
           		A comment section (for a more advanced version)
        </p>
        <p>
            This project will allow me to enhance my skills in deploying websites on a Linux server, managing security, and configuring network settings. Additionally, I plan to integrate more advanced features like CDN, SSL certificates, and automated backups in future versions.
        </p>

    <h2> Choice of Licence</h2>
    <p>
     I chose the MIT license for its simplicity and flexibility. It allows anyone to freely copy, modify,
 and redistribute the code, even for commercial projects. It's one of the most widely used open source licenses in
 the web development world. It's ideal for an educational project like this because it encourages sharing while still
 allowing users to do whatever they want with it. Furthermore, it doesn't require me to open source any modification
